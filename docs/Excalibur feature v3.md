# A — All-Included Features (complete list)

**Intake & Case Creation**

* Case intake
* Structured report form: person type (missing/wanted), name, age, gender, photo(s), last-known location, clothing, distinguishing marks, last-seen time, vehicle info, associated persons.
* Urgency & triage fields: risk category, child/elder/disabled flags, immediate danger flag.

**Alerting & Broadcasts**

* Multi-level alert types (AMBER-style): AMBER (child abduction), SILVER (elderly/mentally vulnerable), RED (ongoing violent crime), YELLOW (hazard/accident). (Law-enforcement approval workflow required.) 
* Targeted geofence broadcasts: push notifications.
* Automatic expiry and manual update/cancellation of alerts (status changes: “Active”, “Under Investigation”, “Found Safe”, “Closed”).

**Geospatial & Mapping**

* Live map view of active cases, sightings, incidents, and public safety advisories.
* Time-decay visualization and heatmap of sightings and reports.
* Timeline view per case: events, sighting timestamps, search actions, police updates.
* Map filters by category, severity, and time-range.

**Crowdsourcing & Tips**

* Anonymous and identified tip submission (text, photo, video, voice notes).
* Quick-report buttons for common cases: "Found Missing Person”, “Report Suspicious Activity”, “Report Hazard”, “Saw Wanted Person”, "Was Attacked", "Found evidence".

**Tip Handling & Quality Control**

* Tip-scoring / credibility metadata: reporter reputation, geotemporal plausibility (used to surface high-value tips).
* Manual verification before issuing police search.

**Volunteer & Search Party Management**

* Two types of volunteers: Active watcher (single) or Watch party (Group)
* Volunteer registration, vetting status, and skill tags (first aid, boat handling, navigation, canine handler).
* Task assignment: create search tasks (grid polygon, time window, volunteer list), check-in/out, and completion reporting.
* Search-grid generation (assignable map tiles or sectors) and printable search packets per volunteer (instructions, last-known position, safety tips).
* Volunteer attendance, shift scheduling.
* Search intensity (basic, rigorous, extreme, pinpoint)

**Police / Authority Tools**

* Case management dashboard: all reports, linked tips, search tasks, evidence, and case notes in one place.
* Hotspot detection: map layers that surface rising incident density and trending areas.
* Auto-notify hospitals of matching descriptors/unknown patients.

**Citizen-Facing Features**

<!-- * Personalized alert zones (home/work radius) and subscription preferences. -->
<!-- * Safety index by area (monthly), based on aggregated, non-sensitive crime and incident data. -->

**Communication & Transparency**

* Public dashboards and monthly stats (alerts issued, resolved cases, volunteer hours) for transparency and trust.
* Reward & recognition module: authorized officers can mark verified helpful reporters (points or recognition badges).
* Immutable chains for evidence/tip records (to preserve chain-of-custody).

**Operational & Incident Support**

* Case file repository: centralized storage for documents, photos, CCTV clips, and police notes tied to case ID.

**Safety / Anti-Abuse**

* Fake report detection heuristics and auto-suspension (repeat abusers flagged).
* Officer confirmation before outreach.  

**Simple Resource Booking**

   * Reserve shared resources (boats, torches, portable radios, transport vans, canines, sensor/detectors) with check-out/check-in logging and condition notes.

<!-- **Lightweight Progressive Web App (PWA)** -->

  <!-- * Offline caching of key pages (submit report form, view nearby alerts) and retrying submissions when connectivity returns — useful in low-coverage areas. -->

**Special search Party**

  * verified specialized area or terrain specific (water, forrest, hilltrack) search party collaboration
