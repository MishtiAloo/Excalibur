## Missing Person & Emergency Network (plus instant crime reporting) ‚Äî upgraded feature set

**Goal:** fast, privacy-aware, actionable public reporting and authoritative coordination between citizens, police, hospitals, and volunteer networks ‚Äî with safeguards to prevent misuse.

### Core features (expanded)

- **Case intake & triage**

  - Multi-channel intake: web, mobile app, SMS, phone operator. Structured form to collect essential details, photos, last-known location, clothing, and urgency category.

- **Geospatial crowdsourcing & timeline**

  - Live map of sightings and reports with time decay and aggregated heatmap. Timeline of confirmed sightings and actions (who searched where and when).

- **Alerting & targeted broadcasts**

  - Targeted push/SMS/social alerts to people within a configurable geofence (similar to AMBER-like broadcasts), with law-enforcement approval workflows to prevent frivolous alerts. AMBER program guidelines require law-enforcement confirmation before issuing public alerts. ([AMBER Alert][6])

- **Image-matching assisted search**

  - Compare submitted photos against datasets (with strict privacy/legal controls), and use reverse-image checks; provide ranked candidate matches with human-in-loop review before any identification is made. Be mindful of accuracy limits and demographic differentials. Use match _confidence thresholds_ and require manual verification for high-impact actions. NIST studies show demographic differentials and advise caution in forensic use. ([NIST][7])

- **License plate & camera (LPR/CCTV) integration**

  - Ingest LPR and CCTV feeds where permitted; automated alerts for candidate plate sightings. (NCMEC has integrated LPR tech to help Amber searches.) ([missingkids.org][8])

- **Volunteer coordination & tasking**

  - Register vetted volunteers, create search task assignments (areas/time), check-in/out, and feed results to case officer.

- **Tip management & evidence chain**

  - Each tip gets a unique ticket; police can escalate, request clarifications, and collect evidence with immutable logs for chain-of-custody.

- **Anonymous reporting + safety controls**

  - Allow anonymous reports with anti-abuse rate limiting and reputation scoring for reporters; protect reporter identity from public disclosure.

- **Crime instant report (non-emergency)**

  - Structured reporting for non-emergencies (theft, vandalism) that auto-generates a police complaint/incident number, offers next steps, and lets citizens upload evidence (photos/videos) with secure timestamping.

### Unique / high-value extras

- **‚ÄúSightings verification‚Äù & tip-scoring**

  - ML model scores tips by credibility (photo quality, reporter reputation, geotemporal plausibility). Low-scoring tips are surfaced to crowdsourcers for validation before police attention.

- **Privacy-preserving biometric checks**

  - When matching facial images, use privacy-preserving techniques (hashing, homomorphic matching, or limited-scope searchable tokens) and always require human review before any identification action ‚Äî and maintain DPIAs (data protection impact assessments) to satisfy regulators.

- **Cross-jurisdiction case handover**

  - Smoothly hand over cases to adjacent agencies with audit trail and synchronized updates.

- **Integration with emergency alert channels**

  - Route high-priority alerts to national alerting systems, social platforms, and electronic signage while respecting traffic-safety guidance (avoid highway signage during rush hours per AMBER cautions). ([Wikipedia][9])

### Implementation & policy cautions

- **Strict governance & law-enforcement gates**

  - Public alerts must be controlled by accredited law enforcement to prevent misuse; false alerts dilute effectiveness (AMBER criteria exist for this reason). ([AMBER Alert][6])

- **Privacy, bias and legal compliance**

  - Facial recognition and biometric processing have measurable demographic differentials and are regulated; follow NIST guidance and regional privacy laws, perform impact assessments, and log human review steps. ([NIST][7])
