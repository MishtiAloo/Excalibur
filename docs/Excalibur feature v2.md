## Missing Person & Emergency Network — upgraded feature set

**Goal:** fast, privacy-aware, actionable public reporting and authoritative coordination between citizens, police, hospitals, and volunteer networks — with safeguards to prevent misuse.

### Core features (expanded)

- **Case intake & triage**

  - Multi-channel intake: web, mobile app, SMS, phone operator. Structured form to collect essential details, photos, last-known location, clothing, and urgency category.

- **Geospatial crowdsourcing & timeline**

  - Live map of sightings and reports with time decay and aggregated heatmap. Timeline of confirmed sightings and actions (who searched where and when).

- **Alerting & targeted broadcasts**

  - Targeted push/SMS/social alerts to people within a configurable geofence (similar to AMBER-like broadcasts), with law-enforcement approval workflows to prevent frivolous alerts. AMBER program guidelines require law-enforcement confirmation before issuing public alerts. ([AMBER Alert][6])

- **Image-matching assisted search**

  - Compare submitted photos against datasets (with strict privacy/legal controls), and use reverse-image checks; provide ranked candidate matches with human-in-loop review before any identification is made. Be mindful of accuracy limits and demographic differentials. Use match _confidence thresholds_ and require manual verification for high-impact actions. NIST studies show demographic differentials and advise caution in forensic use. ([NIST][7])

- **Volunteer coordination & tasking**

  - Register vetted volunteers, create search task assignments (areas/time), check-in/out, and feed results to case officer.

- **Tip management & evidence chain**

  - Each tip gets a unique ticket; police can escalate, request clarifications, and collect evidence with immutable logs for chain-of-custody.

- **Anonymous reporting + safety controls**

  - Allow anonymous reports with anti-abuse rate limiting and reputation scoring for reporters; protect reporter identity from public disclosure.

- **Crime instant report (non-emergency)**

  - Structured reporting for non-emergencies (theft, vandalism) that auto-generates a police complaint/incident number, offers next steps, and lets citizens upload evidence (photos/videos) with secure timestamping.

### Unique / high-value extras

- **“Sightings verification” & tip-scoring**

  - ML model scores tips by credibility (photo quality, reporter reputation, geotemporal plausibility). Low-scoring tips are surfaced to crowdsourcers for validation before police attention.

- **Integration with emergency alert channels**

  - Route high-priority alerts to national alerting systems, social platforms, and electronic signage while respecting traffic-safety guidance (avoid highway signage during rush hours per AMBER cautions). ([Wikipedia][9])
